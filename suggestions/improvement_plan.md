- **Add Indexes to MongoDB Collections**: Add appropriate indexes to MongoDB collections for better query performance
  - File: `src/apps/chats/models.py`
  - Priority: High
  - Effort: Low (2 hours)
  - Impact: High (Improves database query performance)

- **Optimize WebSocket Message Broadcasting**: Improve the WebSocket connection manager to handle message broadcasting more efficiently
  - Files: `src/apps/chats/websocket/connections.py`, `src/apps/chats/websocket/routers.py`
  - Priority: Medium
  - Effort: Medium (6 hours)
  - Impact: High (Improves real-time messaging performance)

### 3. User Experience Enhancements
- **Add Message Read Status**: Implement functionality to mark messages as read and track read status
  - Files: `src/apps/chats/routers.py`, `src/apps/chats/services/chats.py`
  - Priority: Medium
  - Effort: Medium (6 hours)
  - Impact: High (Improves user experience)

- **Add User Typing Indicators**: Implement typing indicators for chat
  - Files: `src/apps/chats/websocket/connections.py`, `src/apps/chats/websocket/routers.py`
  - Priority: Medium
  - Effort: Medium (4 hours)
  - Impact: Medium (Enhances real-time chat experience)

- **Add Endpoint to Retrieve All User Chats**: Implement an endpoint to get all chats for the current user
  - Files: `src/apps/chats/routers.py`, `src/apps/chats/services/chats.py`
  - Priority: High
  - Effort: Low (2 hours)
  - Impact: High (Essential functionality for chat list view)

### 4. Code Quality and Testing
- **Add Unit Tests for Critical Components**: Implement unit tests for authentication, chat, and message services
  - New files in a tests directory
  - Priority: High
  - Effort: High (8 hours)
  - Impact: High (Ensures code reliability)

- **Add Input Validation**: Improve input validation for API endpoints
  - Files: Various schema files
  - Priority: Medium
  - Effort: Medium (4 hours)
  - Impact: High (Prevents invalid data and potential security issues)

- **Add Error Handling for External Services**: Improve error handling for OpenAI and Unsplash API calls
  - Files: `src/apps/ai/services.py`
  - Priority: Medium
  - Effort: Low (2 hours)
  - Impact: Medium (Improves reliability)

- **Add Pre-commit Hooks**: Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks and formatting
  - Files: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - Priority: Medium
  - Effort: Low (2 hours)
  - Impact: High (Ensures consistent code quality and formatting)
